- ~C-u C-u C-u C-c C-x C-i~ Start clock at point at time last clock stopped
- ~C-c C-x C-x~ Clock in last clocked task
- ~C-u C-c C-x C-x~ As above, but select from recently clocked tasks
- ~C-u C-u C-c C-x C-x~ As above, but start clock at time last clock stopped
- ~C-S-<up/down>~ On ~CLOCK~ log lines, increase/decrease both timestamps so
  that the clock duration keeps the same
