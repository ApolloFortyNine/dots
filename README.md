# My Dotfiles

Personal configuration files for the platforms I work on (mostly OS X).


## Installation

	git clone git@github.com:noahfrederick/dots.git ~/.dots
	cd ~/.dots
	git submodule update --init
	./install.sh

Existing configuration files are moved to:

	~/.dots_backup

And new symlinks are created. Existing symlinks will be left as they are.
