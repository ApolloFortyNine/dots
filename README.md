# Nox's *Nix Config Files

My configuration files for the platforms I work on, OS X, Linux (Ubuntu), and occasionally Solaris.
My Vim configuration files and plugins can be found [elsewhere][1].


## Installation

	git clone git://github.com/noahfrederick/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
	~/.dotfiles/install.sh

Existing configuration files are moved to:

	~/.dotfiles_backup

And new symlinks are created. Existing symlinks will be left as they are.
